#here we are going to look at operators

# modulus == %% : you write the sign twice ie 10 %% 3
# addition = +
# subtraction = -
# multiplication = *
#Division = /
# exponent = ^
number <- 10 ^ 3
print(number)
# integer division = %/%
int_division <- 10 %/% 3 # the operator divides the numbers and returns the whole number part of the eqaution 
print(int_division)

# Assignment operators
# <-, ->, <<-, ->> : the last 2 are used for global assignmenments

# comparison operators
# == equal, != not equal, <, >, <=, >=, 

#logical operators
# &, &&, |, ||, ! => 

# R Miscellaneous Operators => they are used to manipulate data
# we have : => this creates a number in a sequence
num1 <- 1:20
print(num1)

# we have matrix manipulation
# num1 %*% num2

# we have checking if an element belongs to a vector 
# num1 %in% num2
