# Plotting in R
# the plot() FUNCTION is used to plot a point
# the first parameter takes x-axis and 2nd the y-axis

# to plot multiple spots
# plot(c(1, 5), c(2, 10)) # nolint

# many spots
# plot(c(1, 2, 3, 5, 4), c(8, 9, 6, 4, 10)) # nolint

# for better organization of the code, you can declare the points differently
# x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# y <- c(3, 7, 8, 9, 12)
#plot(x, y)

# to draw the lines in a sequence
#plot(1:10)

#to draw a line connecting the dots, use the type="1" function
#plot(1:10, type="1") # nolint

plot(1, 5)
